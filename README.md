# Heading Level Indent

**Indenting content under headers based on their level** is a visual technique to create a visual hierarchy that makes it easier to understand the structure and organization of your document and facilitates the application of **selective attention** on specific structure part. 

- For now, it is only awailable in reading view
- You can specify the margins for the content of each heading in plugin settings
- Also you can add your own custom css to the headings and their content, using the classes `data_h1/2/3/4/5/6` and `heading_h1/2/3/4/5/6` appended to each rendered section in reading view
